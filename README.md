I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, as well as web languages like HTML and CSS. Additionally, I have some basic knowledge in cloud computing with GCP. 💻🌐<br><br>Apart from my studies, I am also a YouTuber with a good experience in editing videos. 🎥🎬 I love the process of creating engaging content, and video editing is one of my favorite skills that I have developed over time. Whether it's adding special effects or sound design, I am always looking to push my creativity to the limit. 🎞️🔊<br><br>I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills both in the field of technology and video editing, and I can't wait to see where my passion takes me in the future! 🚀
